## What up, GIT?!?
Just an average cryptid, living on stolen land, learning about all the wires that connect us--<sup>meta</sup>physical<sub>and other</sub>! ðŸ‘»

* open-sourced
- transparently opaque
+ consistently contradictory

I am a langauge monster, and this is another game I would like to learn how to play. 
The only prize I want to win is vibes; and, maybe, to surf the affective wave created by look on Medusa's face the first time she saw her own reflection in the mirror.

The main thing I like to remember is the ritual invocation: `it is not a crime to be seen learning in public`![^1] 
[^1]: This invocation was created by Dr. Craig Gingrich-Philbrook, as the title for a memorial performance in honor of the life of Dr. John T. Warren @ Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.
The first lesson of the day: this readme does not like footnotes that directly follow a "code quotation."[^2]
[^2]: lol. I also appreciate that it doesn't matter where in the document the footnote is located--the compiler cleans it up for publication.
